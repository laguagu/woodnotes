    "1": "Regular care: Vacuum cleaning is sufficient for everyday care of a Woodnotes carpet. Vacuuming under the carpet monthly is also suggested. The carpet has an industrial soil-repellent treatment that can be renewed.",

    "2": "Spot cleaning: Remove stains or spots immediately. Work from the sides of the stain towards the center. For water-soluble stains, dab immediately with a piece of white paper towel or white, absorbent cotton terry towel. Wet a cotton towel with cold water and squeeze out excess water. Treat the affected area by tapping it with a damp towel. For grease stains, add a drop of mild washing-up liquid or textile cleaner. Rinse with a clean damp sponge or towel. Do not rub. Dry the affected area by tapping it with a dry towel.",

    "3": "Deep cleaning: The best way to wash the paper yarn carpet is using a textile washer with steamer, steam-cleaning. Use minimum moisture setting on the machine. Shampoo cleaning with a washer fitted with a vacuum extractor is also recommended. For professional cleaning, use specialist carpet cleaners.",

    "4": "Maintenance: Store the rug rolled evenly, in a horizontal or upright position in an airy and dry place. Do not store anything heavy on top of the rolled rug. If there are lumps on the carpet, you can steam the rug gently with a flat iron over an ironing cloth or use a fabric steamer.",

    "5": "Additional care: To air your carpet, roll it loosely and place it in vertical direction on a flat surface. Do not soak the rug, use bleach, wash or dry in a drum washing machine, use chemical wash, or dry clean.",

    "1": "Regular care: Vacuum once a week (or more often if necessary) to remove dirt and dust. Do not use a beater bar or rotating brush. Regular vacuuming prevents the carpet from absorbing dirt. A new rug will produce fluff, but this is temporary.",

    "2": "Stain removal: Remove stains and spots immediately. For liquid spills, use a piece of paper towel or absorbent colourfast cotton towel (white is recommended). You can also sprinkle baking soda on the spot to soak up moisture, wait about 20 seconds, then vacuum. Repeat until the baking soda stops absorbing liquid. For harder stains, you can try gall soap, but test it on a small area first. Always treat the affected area by tapping gently with a damp sponge or towel, working from the edges towards the center. Do not rub or over-wet the carpet. Rinse with a clean damp sponge or towel and let dry. Remove dried stains carefully with a knife or spoon.",

    "3": "Deep cleaning: Our wool carpets can be cleaned in snow. This traditional method requires a cold day with dry, powdery snow. Take the carpet outside, lay it on the ground piles against the snow, and brush out all the snow with a soft brush. For professional cleaning, use reputable carpet cleaners. Do not wash wool carpets often, soak, bleach, wash/dry in a cylinder machine, or dry clean.",

    "4": "Maintenance: If there are lumps on the carpet, steam the rug backside gently with a flat iron over an ironing cloth or use a fabric steamer. Avoid unnecessary cleaning and washing as it expedites wear and tear.",

    "5": "Storage: When storing, roll the carpet tightly around a cardboard tube with the pile inside. Ensure the bottom of the carpet doesn't wrinkle. Store horizontally in an airy place. Do not store anything heavy on top.",

    "1": "Regular care: Vacuum once a week (more often in heavy traffic areas) to remove dirt and dust. A new rug will produce fluff, but this is temporary. The rug may have lumps or waves from rolling during transport these will even out over time. If necessary, steam the rug gently on backside with a flat iron over an ironing cloth or a fabric steamer.",

    "2": "Stain removal: Remove stains immediately. For liquid spills, use a white paper towel or absorbent cotton towel.

Remove dried stains carefully with a knife or spoon.",

    "3": "Professional cleaning: When necessary, use reputable carpet cleaners. Avoid water washing as it strains the rug. Try to maintain cleanliness without water washing to prevent expedited wear and tear.",

    "4": "Storage: Roll the carpet tightly around a cardboard tube with the pile inside, ensuring the bottom doesn't wrinkle. Store horizontally in an airy, dry place. Don't place heavy items on top of the rolled rug.",

    "1": "Regular care: Vacuum cleaning is sufficient for everyday care. Always use the standard floor head, never the rotating brush. Vacuuming under the carpet is also suggested. Rotate the rug regularly. The material is 100% polypropylene, which may show foot or furniture prints - you can smooth these by hand.",

    "2": "Stain removal: React immediately to spills. For water-based stains, use warm soapy water. For oil-based stains, use a spray dry cleaning or textile cleaner for synthetic fibers. Dab spills with a white paper towel or cotton terry towel, working from the edges towards the center. For stubborn oil stains, you can use acetone on a white towel. Rinse with a damp sponge and dry thoroughly before use.",

    "3": "Cleaning: Avoid unnecessary cleaning. When needed, use a mild detergent and lukewarm water (max 40°C). Brush gently and rinse thoroughly. Let the rug dry completely before use. Do not bleach, tumble dry, iron, or dry clean. Professional cleaning is recommended when needed.",

    "4": "Outdoor use: While suited for moist and humid conditions, do not let the product sit in water or expose it to prolonged water contact. Protect the carpet when you would use rain protection yourself.",

    "5": "Maintenance: You can protect the clean carpet with a soil-repellent treatment. For storage during extended periods of non-use, clean and dry thoroughly, then roll up and store in a dry, cool place.",

    "1": "Regular care: Vacuum the carpet regularly and air it out. We recommend using both sides of the rug for even wear. The carpet stays clean with regular vacuuming.",

    "2": "Initial care: The carpet may have bulges due to rolling during transportation. These will flatten out with use. If needed, steam the rug with an iron through an ironing textile.",

    "3": "Stain removal: Remove stains immediately. For loose dirt, gently scrape. For liquid stains, absorb with a clean towel. Clean with a neutral detergent solution (e.g., dish soap or textile stain remover) at about 30°C. Carefully tap with a cleaning towel, don't rub. For harder stains, test gall soap on a small area first.",

    "4": "Deep cleaning: Always vacuum and remove stains before washing. Professional cleaning is recommended, either through level washing or spray extraction in a laundry. Alternatively, use a textile washer with steamer on minimum moisture setting. Use water at 30°C with a pH 6 detergent. Don't soak or spin-dry. Dry flat in an airy place.",

    "5": "Storage and maintenance: Store the rug rolled evenly in a horizontal position in an airy, dry place. Don't store heavy items on top. The carpets are supplied with a dirt-repellent treatment that withstands washing. Note that in the first wash, carpets may slightly soften and shrink by approximately 3%.",

    "1": "Regular care: Keep the rug tidy with regular hoovering, light brushing, and airing. We recommend flipping the rug over sometimes for even wear. Wool is naturally dirt resistant. Do not beat or shake the rug vigorously.",

    "2": "Stain removal: Remove stains immediately. For loose dirt, lightly scratch or brush with a soft brush. For liquid stains, absorb with a clean cloth or white kitchen roll. For dried stains, brush gently with a soft brush. If the surface is dirty, clean by pressing gently with a cleaning cloth and a neutral, diluted washing agent (pH approx. 7). Water temperature should be around 30°C. For harder stains, test gall soap on a small area first.",

    "4": "Washing: A water wash strains woolen rugs, so try to maintain cleanliness without it. If necessary, we recommend professional cleaning with a flatbed wash or spray-extraction cleaner. Always remove stains and vacuum before washing. Minore rugs may soften and shrink slightly when washed. Handle wet rugs with care to avoid damaging the wool - do not rub, twist, or stretch.",

    "5": "Professional cleaning: For flatbed wash, use 30°C water and a diluted neutral washing agent of pH 7. Wash by hand with a soft brush, rinse well, and squeeze out excess water. For spray-extraction, use a neutral washing agent of pH 7. Dry the rug over a flat surface in an airy place. Do not soak, use bleach, wash/dry in a drum machine, or use chemical wash.",
